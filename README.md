# first_powerbi_project
This project is a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to visualize and analyze sales performance across various dimensions. It includes interactive visualizations to track key metrics such as total sales, profit, and units sold over different time periods, with date filters for dynamic analysis (e.g., Date Filter 1: 01-01-2020 to 24-08-2022, Date Filter 2: 01-01-2020 to 01-01-2024). The dashboard compares performance metrics between two periods, showing significant growth (e.g., total sales increased from 78M to 122M, profit from 7.8M to 12.2M, and units sold from 4.6K to 7.1K). It also features top and bottom product rankings by sales, profit, and quantity sold, highlighting best performers like the Apple iPhone 14 (21.4M in sales) and underperformers like Colgate Toothpaste (0.02M). Additional insights include sales trends by period, geographic distribution of sales across Indian cities (e.g., 3510 total orders), and a scatter plot of profit vs. net sales. A detailed table provides granular data on customer orders, including discounts applied during promotions like "Festive Diwali." This project demonstrates proficiency in data visualization, business intelligence, and actionable insights generation for sales optimization.
